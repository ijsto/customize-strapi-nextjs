## About

This is a Next.js starter project with dynamic layouts.

The purpose is to have different layouts for different parts of your website. For example you may want to display a different layout for user dashboard, single blog post and blog post lists - we'll call them SingleBookLayout instead of SingleBlogPost, because why not. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

This example has been prepared to core 2 cases - main layout and single blog post.
